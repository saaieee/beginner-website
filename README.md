# beginner-website

[OLD PROJECT | Jan 2022]
Decided to create a very basic website to refresh my html css and javascript skills ! will be using this to track my progress moving further :)
one thing that was a pleasant surprise is how muscle memory starts taking over and increasing the speed of my planning and executing process.
I hope this website showcases how quick i can apply my foundational knowledge on to code. 
Excited to upload newer projects showing more to the world !
